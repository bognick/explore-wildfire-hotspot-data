# A data exploration notebook that finds the true big-scale wildfire cases from satellite hotspot data
The purporse of the present data exploration notebook is to find the true big-scale wildfire cases using the FireHub hotspot service which is based mostly on the SEVIRI geostationary satellite.

In the next project I will use these wildfire cases to validate different wildfire prediction models that comprise a Dynamic Data Driven Assimilation System (DDDAS) for wildfires, which calibrates a wildfire prediction model based on real-time wildfire hotspot data in order to make more accurate predictions of the wildfire course in the immediate future. In general a static wildfire model makes prediction based on static input parameters (weather, topography) which do not change during the simulation. This phenomenon leads to significant model drift as the prediction window increases. In contrary a Dynamic Data Driven Assimilation System for wildfires incorporates any updated information about the state of the wildfire in order to calibrate the wildfire model and make more accurate predictions.
